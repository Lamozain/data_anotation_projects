"Within one week of treatment superficial acne lesions were visibly reduced.  Sebum production which had been excessive before beginning was significantly reduced (after course of treatment level increased to a more normal level).  After one month of treatment no new acne lesions occured.  By the end of treatment no new acne developed, and old lesions had healed."
