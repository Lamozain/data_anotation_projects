LinkedIn Learning was founded as Lynda.com in 1995 in Ojai, California, as online support for the books and classes of Lynda Weinman, a special effects animator and multimedia professor who co-founded a digital arts school with her husband, artist Bruce Heavin. In 2002, the company began offering courses online. By 2004, there were 100 courses, and in 2008, the company began producing and publishing documentaries on creative leaders, artists, and entrepreneurs. In 2013, Lynda.com received its first outside investment, raising $103 million in growth equity from Accel Partners and Spectrum Equity, with additional contributions from Meritech Capital Partners. On January 14, 2015, Lynda.com announced it had raised $186 million in financing, led by the investment group TPG Capital. On April 9, 2015, LinkedIn announced its intention to buy Lynda.com in a deal valued at $1.5 billion, which officially closed on May 14, 2015. In 2016, Lynda.com began broadcasting courses on their Apple TV application. On June 13, 2016, Microsoft announced that it would acquire Lynda.com's parent company, LinkedIn, for $26.2 billion. The acquisition was completed on December 8, 2016. In October 2017, Lynda.com was merged and renamed LinkedIn Learning. In 2019, the site announced that users accessing LinkedIn Learning through their public library would be required to create a LinkedIn profile to use the service; the decision faced criticism from librarians and the American Library Association. As of March 2021, libraries started migrating to LinkedIn Learning without requiring patrons to create a LinkedIn profile. On June 2, 2021, the Lynda.com site was shut down and is now permanently redirected to LinkedIn Learning.
